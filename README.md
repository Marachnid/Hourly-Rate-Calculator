# Hourly-Rate-Calculator
An hourly rate calculator built using a LAMP stack

This was a second-semester project of mine where we could make an application of our choosing for Project 3 of my Intro to PHP class. It utilizes a templating system to reuse file components, integrates with MySql to allow users to sign in, save generic profile data, and calculate their salary into an equivalent hourly rate. 

Here's a YouTube link for a demonstration of my project! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtByIOG-Lak
